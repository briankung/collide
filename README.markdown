# Collide

Collide brings together 3 aspects of implementing an idea: Concept, Code, and Collaboration. 

Co(ncept|de|llaboration) -> Collide.

## Principles

* Ideas without implementation are worthless.
* Code without evaluation is dangerous. 
* Collaboration lets us improve our ideas, our code, and our skills.

## Cast of Heroes

**Concepters** - the idea people, the visionaries, the luminaries. Concepters come up with the spark that starts the fire.

**Coders** - powerful sorcerors, Coders use arcane words to reconstruct our reality, or create it from raw bits.

**Collaborators** - the couriers of the modern world, Collaborators bring the future to the masses.

## Collide!

**Concepters, Coders,** and **Collaborators** Collide to bring ideas to life all around the world. Here's how it works:

1. A **Concepter** thinks of a great idea. It could be a website, an application, or just a Cool Thingâ„¢. He adds concept art, mockups, and as much detail as he can cram in. Other people love the idea and the fidelity of the Concept and they vote it to the top.
2. A **Coder** looks over the day's list of Concepts, and one catches her eye. She spends nights and weekends working on it as a labor of love. Finally, she finishes and submits an Implementation for the Concept. Fellow coders appreciate her attention to variable naming and vote it up. The Concepter, meanwhile, is delighted that his idea came to life and adds his own vote as well.
3. A **Collaborator** loves everything about the Concept and its Implementation and can't wait to show it off to her friends. She sends a link to her friends and gets reputation points for referring people to the Implementation.

This way, Concepters, Coders, and Collaborators all get points for bringing new ideas into the world.

## FAQ

### Are these points worth anything?

No.

Well, you can't trade them in for anything. But yes, they definitely are worth something. They're your peers' evaluations, kudos, and encouragement to keep on going! And you can show off your best projects with pride.

### Am I stuck as a Co(ncepter|der|llaborator)?

Absolutely not. Everyone is considered a multiclass hero from the get go.

### What about Intellectual Property?

Collaboration is a core principle of Collide, so every Concept is Creative Commons and every Implementation is open source. You may choose the copyright or license that best fits your needs, as long as it is compatible with Creative Commons or GPL.

You can start a business off of it as long as the license allows proprietary forks, or go fully FOSS with the product and sell a service.
